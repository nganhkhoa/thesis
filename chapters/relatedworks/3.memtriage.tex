\section[Memtriage]{Memtriage}

Memtriage \cite{memtriage} is a wrapper around the Rekall WinPmem driver and
Volatility to do live forensics with Volatility.  This project can make
Volatility works on live systems. There have been crashes reported on some
Windows versions.  Memtriage uses the WinPmem driver, so the protocol is the
same as Rekall when performing live forensics. Memtriage is a Volatility fork,
but the Volatility history tree is missing, in orther words, update from
Volatility is not directly picked up by Memtriage. Memtriage will likely miss
updates from the Volatility project.

\section[SysInternal]{SysInternal}

SysInternal \cite{sysinternal} is a suite of programs made by Mark Russinovich,
now redistributed by Windows. Two programs that are used by malware analysts to
inspect the system are Process Explorer and Process Monitor.  Process explorer
is basically Task manager with verbose information. Process explorer uses
Windows API to query the systems for process and threads information.  Process
Monitor captures events by Windows and displays them in a GUI. Process Monitor
can capture process/thread creation, termination, file access, registry access,
network activities, and many more. On a live machine, process monitor is very
useful to know what process is doing so that malware analysts can narrow down
process by process to find the malware writing registry values, edit a file, or
connecting to a remote server.

Rekall on Chapter 4, the current tools used for finding hidden process are
forensics tools and live system queries. Forensics tools requires the memory
file to be extracted and the live system queries misses information that could
only be found when doing forensics. We hope to deliver a quick and nice
solution to perform memory forensics on a live machine.

This chapter introduces LPUS, a system capable of doing live memory forensics
without extracting the RAM contents. In short, LPUS uses a kernel-mode driver
to locate the kernel base and efficiently walks the kernel structures without
breaking the systems. Since LPUS can locate the appropriate kernel address to
be accessed, it does not require the memory file. LPUS uses forensics to help
users find malware by implementing some standard scans and collecting
information crucial for identifying hidden malware.

\section[Overall result]{Overall result}

During the studies and work on the thesis topic, ``Finding hidden processes in
a running machine'', we have gained knowledge on using forensics methods to
detect hidden processes. Not only that, but we have also implemented a
prototype, LPUS system, to perform forensics without using the memory file and
running live. The first tests with LPUS show positive results in Windows 7 and
Windows 10.

\section[Future works]{Future works}

LPUS is at its final stage for the thesis outcome. The results are still
printed out to the console. We hope to have a Graphical User Interface, GUI,
and display information in a more comprehensible way. LPUS is still having many
issues, big and small. These issues have to be fixed to provide a more stable
experience.

The current status of LPUS performs a few forensics methods, yet we can
implement more forensics methods and make LPUS a competitive tool alongside
with Volatility and Process Explorer. To do this, extensive research into the
Windows Internal and malware analysis are needed.  LPUS can be extended to make
a shell, like VolShell or Rekall interactive shell, where users can program to
perform automatic analysis.

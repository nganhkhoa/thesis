\section[SysInternal]{SysInternal}

Sysinternals \cite{sysinternal} is a suite of programs made by Mark
Russinovich, now redistributed by Windows. Two programs that are used by
malware analysts to inspect the system are Process Explorer and Process
Monitor.  Process Explorer is a Task manager with verbose information. Process
Explorer uses Windows API to query the systems for process and threads
information.  Process Monitor captures events by Windows and displays them in a
GUI. Process Monitor can capture process/thread creation, termination, file
access, registry access, network activities and many more. On a live machine,
Process Monitor is handy to know what process is doing so that malware analysts
can narrow down process by process to find the malware writing registry values,
edit a file, or connecting to a remote server.
